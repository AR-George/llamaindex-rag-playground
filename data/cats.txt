Cats: Fascinating Felines

Cats are known for their agility and grace, often landing on their feet thanks to their flexible spines and unique skeletal structure.

They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including purring, meowing, and hissing, each serving different purposes.

Domestic cats are descendants of wildcats and have been companions to humans for thousands of years.

They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in light levels six times lower than what a human needs.

Cats spend a significant portion of their lives grooming themselves, which helps them stay clean and regulate their body temperature.
